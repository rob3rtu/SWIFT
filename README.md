# SWIFT
ï£¿ Projects made learning Swift 

# Disclaimer

This is an old repo and the apps are using UIKit. I haven't worked on it for a while so I forgot most of it's content.


# What do I learned:

###### RandomColors: working with storyboard, ViewController, TableView, Segue.

###### CardWorkout: More practice

###### CardWorkout-Programmatic: working without storyboard, rebuilding the app in a programmatic way

###### ExchangeApp: working with API Requests
